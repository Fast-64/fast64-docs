| You will need an extended ROM (unless you only want to import Mario's animations, which are uncompressed).
| For this, you can use `ROM Manager <https://pilzinsel64.de/sm64-rom-manager/>`_ 
    or alternatively `sm64Extend <https://smwc.me/s/20095>`_.

Enable *"Show Importing Menus"* in the panel *"SM64 General Settings"*. 
Then set the *"Import ROM"* to your extended ROM's path.
