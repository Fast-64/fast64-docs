First, you must acquire an extended ROM (unless you only intend on importing Mario's animations which are uncompressed).
For this, you can use `ROM Manager <https://pilzinsel64.de/sm64-rom-manager/>`_ 
or alternatively `sm64Extend <https://smwc.me/s/20095>`_.

Enable ``Show Importing Menus`` in the panel ``SM64 General Settings``. 
Then set the ``Import Rom`` to your extended ROM's path.
