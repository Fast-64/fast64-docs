# Color Combiner

In one and two cycle mode, the color combiner takes input from the texturing unit. The color combiner is fed various inputs, and combines them via user set inputs. Pixel output from the color combiner is fed into the chroma key & alpha fix up unit and then into the alpha compare unit.

## Inputs

The color combiner has inputs a, b, c, d for color and alpha separately.
See [f3d_materials](f3d_materials.md##Color Combiner) for some explanation on various inputs.

Inputs values are [q1.8  {math}`[0-511]`]{.math-literal} where [{math}`256 == 1.0`]{.math-literal}.
Input variables `A`, `B`, and `D` use a special sign extension [{math}`[-0.5 - 1.5)`]{.math-literal}, while `C` uses uses two's compliment [{math}`[-1.0 - 1.0)`]{.math-literal}.

:::{admonition} Note
1.0 is the only value set to 256 specifically, while others are set to a max of 255. This can allow for overflow via combined input on `C` if passing 1.0.

## Outputs

The combiner equation {math}`Color = (A-B)*C + D` is performed on each cycle. The output of the first cycle is fed to the 2nd cycle under `combined`. The final combined color is subject to the special sign extension [{math}`[-0.5 - 1.5)`]{.math-literal}.
If `key_en` is enabled, then combined color will be replaced with A input, and combined alpha replaced with `key_alpha`.
Output of the color combiner value goes to Alpha Fix Up & Chroma Key Units.

## Chroma Key

Chroma key applies alpha based on the distance from the pixel color from the key value. Chroma key will decrease alpha from a max of key_width based on the distance of key_center from the pixel color. The scale of that alpha change is bas on key_scale (key_scale == 1.0/edge_size), with higher scales resulting in faster changes in alpha.

The color combiner expects the last used cycle to have a setup of {eq}`chroma_key_combiner`. After which, the chroma key unit will perform {eq}`key_alpha_calc` get the `key_alpha` with the min being taken over the r,g,b channels. Chroma key calculations are applied before special sign extension and downshifting (e.g. vals are s1.16).
`key_center`, and `key_scale` are [q0.7  {math}`[0-255]`]{.math-literal} values, while key width is a [s7.4  {math}`[0-4096]`]{.math-literal} value. A width over 1.0 disables chroma key calculations, upon which `key_alpha` is set to 0.
:::{card}
$$
combined\_color = (A - key\_center)*key\_scale + 0
$$(chroma_key_combiner)
$$
key\_alpha = clamp(0, key\_width - abs(combined\_color), 255)
$$(key_alpha_calc)
:::
When `key_en` is enabled, the combined color is replaced with the `A_Color` combiner input.
If `alpha_cvg_sel` is disabled, `combined_alpha` is replaced with `key_alpha`.

## Alpha Fix Up

The alpha fix up applies changes to coverage and combined alpha based on rdp flag selection:

* Shade alpha is clamped to 0xff (since it is blender input).
* cvg_x_alpha - multiplies combined alpha and cvg and uses as cvg (not key alpha), alpha values of 0xff are set to 0x100 for this calc (not that important tbh)
* alpha_cvg_sel - uses cvg value for alpha out (overwrites key alpha)

## Alpha Compare

Alpha compare is performed after alpha fix up unit. The alpha compare unit takes the cycle 1 combined alpha and compares it to a test value. Alpha compare can be enabled in either threshold or dither modes.
* Threshold will disable writing if combined alpha < threshold
* Dither will disable writing if combined alpha < random value

:::{admonition} Note
In 2 cycle mode, alpha compare uses the combined alpha from cycle 1. It will also use the next pixel coverage if `alpha_cvg_sel` is enabled.
